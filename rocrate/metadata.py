    Return a tuple of the corresponding identifiers (descriptor, root).

    but they don't satisfy the required constraints, raise ValueError.

    In the general case, the metadata file descriptor id can be an
    absolute URI whose last path segment is "ro-crate-metadata.json[ld]".
    Since there can be more than one such id in the crate, we need to
    choose among the corresponding (descriptor, root) entity pairs. First, we
    exclude those that don't satisfy other constraints, such as the
    descriptor entity being of type CreativeWork, etc.; if this doesn't
    leave us with a single pair, we try to pick one with a
    heuristic. Suppose we are left with the (m1, r1) and (m2, r2) pairs:
    if r1 is the actual root of this crate, then m2 and r2 are regular
    files in it, and as such they must appear in r1's hasPart; r2,
    however, is not required to have a hasPart property listing other
    files. Thus, we look for a pair whose root entity "contains" all
    descriptor entities from other pairs. If there is no such pair, or there
    is more than one, we just return an arbitrary pair.
